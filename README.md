# EsapiDataLibrary

A library that will grow over time and be used as a way to get some data that you would see in Eclipse, e.g., Structures, StructureSets, etc. 
These dummy models will not be perfect representations of the models found in Eclipse but they will have some of the basic features that you may see in your code. 

This is useful for debugging and testing views, etc. outside of the Eclipse environment.
